          <h3>E-Bicycle Project Recognized by IIT Delhi</h3>
            <p>UBA students have embarked on a transformative project aimed at revolutionizing transportation in rural India. Their endeavor, titled "Design and Development of Low-Cost Converted E-Bicycle for Panjari Lodhi Village," is a blend of innovative engineering and sustainable development principles. The project's focal point lies in Panjari Lodhi Village, nestled amidst the rustic landscape of rural India, where transportation woes have long plagued the local populace. Recognizing the need for an affordable and eco-friendly mobility solution, the UBA students, armed with their ingenuity and determination, set out to make a difference. At the heart of their initiative is the conversion of old, conventional bicycles into hybrid electric bicycles. This ingenious approach not only breathes new life into discarded cycles but also presents a cost-effective alternative to traditional electric bicycles. By repurposing existing resources, the project aims to achieve a remarkable 40-50% reduction in transportation costs for the residents of Panjari Lodhi Village, thereby fostering economic empowerment and accessibility.</p>

        <h1>SMART SOLAR STREET LAMP</h1>
       
    </div>
        <div class="project-content">
            <h3>Smart Solar Street Lamp Project Earns VNIT Nagpur Recognition</h3>
            <p>We are proud to announce that the 2021 pass-out alumni of the E&TC Department, Mr. Atharva Hampiholi and Mr. Ashutosh Maske, along with the support of second-year students from the E&TC Department—1) Yogendra Topre, 2) Mehandi Bhoyar, 3) Prajwal Atkale, 4) Prathamesh Lakhe, 5) Rohit Thakre, 6) Sahil Padole, 7) Sakshi Bhoyar, 8) Shruti Kayarkar, 9) Shubhangi Kaikadi, and 10) Tajshree Zade—from St. Vincent Pallotti College of Engineering and Technology, Nagpur, have successfully installed a 'Smart Solar Street Lamp' in the village of Khatmari under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan, a flagship program of the Government of India for rural development.

              This solar lamp is equipped with multiple proprietary smart features, including an automatic solar panel cleaning system, automatic battery cutoff under low voltage, automatic night light, and an anti-theft alarm.
              
              Due to the accumulation of dust on the surface of solar panels, their efficiency can drop by up to 30%, resulting in a significantly reduced operation time. In the worst-case scenario, the lamp may stop working completely. The automatic cleaning system ensures that the solar lamp continues to function without the need for maintenance. This feature alone increases energy efficiency by 15% to 25%.
              
              Additionally, other smart features prevent battery over-discharge, thereby extending battery lifespan and eliminating the need for human intervention to turn the lamp on or off.</p>

            <h3>Automated Urea Spraying Drone</h3>
            <p>In response to the challenges faced by farmers in Vidarbha, such as unpredictable rainfall and water scarcity, our team is developing an innovative solution under the Unnat Bharat Abhiyan 2.0. We are designing and implementing an automated farming system for Khatmari Village, leveraging the power of drone technology and machine learning. This project aims to improve crop yields, reduce reliance on manual labor, and enhance the overall economic well-being of the farming community. By utilizing a DJI Pro drone equipped with a high-resolution camera, we will collect data on various factors like soil moisture and crop health. This data will be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices. Our solution will not only increase efficiency but also minimize risks associated with traditional farming methods, ultimately empowering farmers and contributing to the sustainable development of the region.
